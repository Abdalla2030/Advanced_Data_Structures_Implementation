# Advanced_Data_Structures_Implementation
Implementation of some data structures like BTree, suffix trie and suffix array

***************************************************************************************************
Assignment 1  ( BTree )

* Implement a BTree data structure as described in our lecture with O(n) space and O(log n) Insert() and O(n) Print() operations.
* Use only standard C++, such that the following main() works. You are not allowed to modify the main().
* Your coding style must follow exactly the coding style specified in CodingStyle.pdf.
* Your code must be general and works for other data types and orders.
* You can assume that the number of levels in the BTree will not exceed 50.
* You are not allowed to include any files or built-in libraries, except for output.
* Do not write the main() again in your submission.
